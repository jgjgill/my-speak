안녕하세요, 제라드 씨. 잠시 시간 괜찮으세요?
제 거실에 있는 화분이 너무 자라서 **분갈이를 해야 할 것 같아요**{it needs to be repotted}.
사실, 전 한 번도 해본 적이 없어서요.
항상 식물을 잘 키우시던데, **혹시 조언을 좀 받을 수 있을까요**{could I possibly get some advice}?
물론이죠! 가장 중요한 건 뿌리가 다치지 않게 조심하고, **배수가 잘 되는 흙**{soil with good drainage}을 사용하는 거예요.
아하, 그렇군요! 정말 감사합니다. 주말에 한번 해봐야겠어요.

Hello, Mr. Gerard. Do you have a moment?
The plant in my living room has grown so much that I think it needs to be repotted.
Actually, I've never done it before.
You're always so good with plants, could I possibly get some advice?
Of course! The most important thing is to be careful not to damage the roots and to use soil with good drainage.
Oh, I see! Thank you so much. I'll give it a try this weekend.
