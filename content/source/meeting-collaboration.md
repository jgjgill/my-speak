# 1단계: 한글 스크립트

오늘 오후 3시에 **중요한 프로젝트 회의**{important project meeting}가 있습니다.
지난주에 우리가 논의했던 **마케팅 전략**{marketing strategy}에 대해 다시 검토해야 합니다.
각 팀원들이 준비한 자료를 발표할 예정이며, 특히 **예산 배분**{budget allocation}과 **일정 관리**{schedule management}가 핵심 이슈가 될 것 같습니다.
만약 **모든 부서가 협력한다면**{all departments cooperate}, 이번 프로젝트는 성공적으로 완료될 수 있을 것입니다.
하지만 **예상치 못한 문제**{unexpected problems}가 발생할 가능성도 있으므로, **백업 계획**{backup plans}을 미리 준비해 두는 것이 좋겠습니다.
회의 후에는 결정된 사항들을 **문서로 정리하여**{organize into documents} 모든 **관련자에게 공유**{share with all stakeholders}할 계획입니다.
다음주까지 각자의 **역할과 책임을 명확히**{clarify each person's role and responsibilities} 하고, 첫 번째 **중간 점검**{interim review}을 실시하겠습니다.

# 2단계: 영어 스크립트

We have an important project meeting at 3 PM today.
We need to review the marketing strategy that we discussed last week.
Each team member will present the materials they've prepared, and budget allocation and schedule management will likely be the key issues.
If all departments cooperate, this project can be completed successfully.
However, there's also a possibility that unexpected problems might occur, so it would be good to prepare backup plans in advance.
After the meeting, we plan to organize the decided matters into documents and share them with all stakeholders.
By next week, we'll clarify each person's role and responsibilities, and conduct the first interim review.
