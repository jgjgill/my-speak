안녕하세요, 오늘 계약 조건에 대해 논의하러 왔습니다.
먼저 **전체적인 프로젝트 범위**{overall project scope}를 명확히 하고 싶습니다.
저희가 제안하는 조건들을 검토해보시겠습니까?
**단가 협상**{unit price negotiation}부터 시작하는 것이 좋겠네요.
현재 제시하신 가격은 저희 예산을 초과합니다.
**할인 혜택**{discount benefits}을 고려해주실 수 있을까요?
납기는 협상 가능하지만, **품질 보증 조건**{quality assurance terms}은 양보할 수 없습니다.
**지불 조건**{payment terms}은 어떻게 설정하실 건가요?
저희는 **분할 지불**{installment payment} 방식을 선호합니다.
**위약금 조항**{penalty clause}에 대해서도 논의해야겠습니다.
**계약서 초안**{contract draft}을 검토한 후 최종 결정하겠습니다.
양측 모두에게 **윈-윈**{win-win} 상황이 되도록 합의점을 찾아보겠습니다.
**법무팀 검토**{legal team review} 후에 정식 계약을 체결하겠습니다.
